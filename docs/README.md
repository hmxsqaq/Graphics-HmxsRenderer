# HmxsRenderer

> `HmxsRenderer` is a simple software 3D renderer without third-party libraries. It is written in pure C++ and uses `Windows GDI` for rendering.

This project is an iteration of my previous project [Graphics - TinyRenderer](https://github.com/hmxsqaq/Graphics-TinyRenderer) and is inspired by the project [tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki) by Dmitry V. Sokolov.

Compared to the previous project, this project has more features such as: `runtime display` and `a simple user interface`. And the code is more organized and more compliant with the modern C++ standard.

I wrote this renderer to learn more about 3D graphics and to have fun. It is not intended to be a production-ready renderer. Although the renderer is simple and slow, it provides good practice for me in learning the fundamentals of 3D graphics.
